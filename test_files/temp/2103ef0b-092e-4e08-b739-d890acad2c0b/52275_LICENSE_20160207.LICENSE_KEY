THIS AGREEMENT ('Agreement') is made by and between EEG Software LLC, 
a California limited liability corporation ('Licensor') and Licensee,
with reference to the following facts:

A. Licensor is the owner of certain proprietary technical information
including computer software and a software protection device ('dongle')
designed for the purpose of administering neurofeedback ('Software System'). 

B. Licensee is desirous of acquiring a non-exclusive license to use 
the Software System, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1.0    LICENSE

1.1    Licensor, at the request of Licensee, grants to Licensee and Licensee 
hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive 
license to use the Software System on one computer system ('Computer System'),
during the Term of this License, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

2.0    TERM OF LICENSE  AND TERMINATION

2.1    The license granted herein shall be for a period commencing on the 
date of this Agreement and continuing until the occurrence of one or more of 
the following:

   (a) If Licensee shall fail to fulfill one or more of Licensee's 
obligations under this Agreement, Licensor may, upon its election and in 
addition to any other remedies that it may have, any time, terminate all the 
rights granted by it under this Agreement by not less than one (1) months' 
written notice to Licensee specifying any such breach, unless within the 
period of such notice all breaches specified therein shall have been remedied 
to Licensor's satisfaction.  

   (b) At such time, if ever, that the Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') 
or any other governing body determines that the Software System no longer 
qualifies for an exemption or is registered for its intended use.

2.2    Upon any termination of the license granted hereunder, Licensee shall 
destroy all copies of the Software System in its possession or under its control 
and certify such destruction in writing to Licensor within fifteen (15) days.  
The software protection device ('dongle') shall be returned to Licensor within 
thirty (30) days.

In the event of any termination, Licensor shall have no obligation to refund 
any amounts paid it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.


3.0    LICENSEE REQUIREMENTS

3.1    Consistent with Licensee's interpretation of the FDA medical device 
waiver registration granted to Licensor, Licensor has developed certain 
requirements for Licensee qualifications, which qualifications are a condition 
to the continued validity of the license granted herein.

3.2    Licensee must comply with all rules, regulations, restrictions, laws 
and statutes imposed by the governmental or licensing board or agency in the 
state or similar political subdivision in which Licensee practices. To the 
extent the requirements set forth below are less stringent or comprehensive 
than any requirements imposed by any governmental or licensing board or agency 
in the state in which the Licensee practices, such governmental or licensing 
board or agency requirements shall supplant, or be in addition to, the 
requirements set forth below. 

3.3    Licensees must practice in compliance with the laws and regulations 
that apply to their geographic area, and shall practice solely within their 
areas of professional competence, and licensure or equivalent certification. 

3.4    Licensee  must complete a comprehensive training course which includes 
hands-on training with the Software System. Any such course must be approved by 
Licensor in writing.  Licensee  must also meet one of the following 
requirements: 

  (a)   A Doctoral Degree or a Masters Degree and a license or certification 
that permits independent practice in a mental health or health care related 
field.

  (b)  A Masters Degree and (only while) practicing under the supervision of a school, 
institutionally-based, or private-practicing mental health or health care 
related field licensed provider.
   
3.5    Licensee agrees to use the Software System only in the course of his 
or her own practice.  Qualified employees and associates of the licensee may 
operate the Software System under the supervision of the Licensee, provided 
that such employees and associates understand, abide by, and agree in writing 
to adhere to the terms of this Agreement.

3.6    Licensee agrees that Licensee will not use in advertising, publicity, 
packaging, labeling or otherwise any trade name, trademark, trade device, 
service mark, symbol, or any other identification or any abbreviation, 
contraction or simulation thereof owned by Licensor or any of its affiliates 
or used by Licensor or any of its affiliates to identify any of its or their 
products or services,  unless by the express written consent of the Licensor.
   
3.7    Licensor may waive, in its sole and absolute discretion, any of the 
Licensee requirements in recognition of an individual's contribution to the 
field of neurofeedback or the behavioral/mental health care area.  Any such 
waiver by Licensor will be situation specific and is not to be considered a 
waiver or relinquishment of  any of the requirements as they apply to any 
other prospective or existing Licensee. 

4.0    SYSTEM UTILIZATION

The sole intended use of the licensed Software System is for relaxation 
training. This is in compliance with the FDA 510(k) medical device waiver 
(registration) issued for the Software System. Licensee agrees that any 
methods, procedures or protocols provided by others or developed by Licensee 
are beyond the scope of the FDA approved use. Accordingly, Licensee agrees 
to defend, indemnify and hold Licensor free and harmless from any and all 
suits, liability, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' 
fees) arising out of or related in any manner to the use of the Software 
System other than for its intended use.

5.0    LICENSEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNIFICATION:

Licensee agrees that Licensee is solely responsible for all aspects of 
Licensee's practice and Licensee's delivery of services to the public.  
Licensor has no responsibility, authority, or control whatsoever with respect 
to the actions or omissions of Licensee.  Licensor makes no representations or 
warranties, whether express or implied, as to the professional fitness or 
competence of Licensee or employees or associates of Licensee.  Licensee 
acknowledges and agrees that Licensor and its officers, directors, employees, 
agents and other licensees assume no responsibility for Licensee's activities.  

Licensee agrees to comply with the provisions of this Agreement including any 
attachments, addenda  and appendices hereto, and to defend, indemnify and hold 
Licensor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents  and  
licensees, free and harmless from and against any and all suits, damage, 
liability, loss, cost and expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) 
arising from or related to any breach of this Agreement and/or use of the 
System Software, by Licensee, its employees, independent contractors or agents.

6.0    ASSIGNMENT

Licensee shall not sell, assign, or transfer this Agreement, or any interest 
herein, including the license granted hereunder, or any interest in the 
Software System, or sub-license or franchise the System Software (herein 
collectively 'Transfer'), without the prior written consent of Licensor, which 
consent may be given or withheld in Licensor's sole discretion.  Any Transfer 
in violation of the previous sentence shall be void. No right to print or copy 
the Software System, in whole or in part is granted, except that Licensor may 
make one copy for back-up  purposes, to be used in the event of a computer or 
software failure only.

7.0    ENHANCEMENTS

The license granted hereunder does not entitle Licensee to a license to use any 
enhancements or modifications or substitutes made to the Software System by 
Licensor. However, Licensor may hereafter offer such enhancements, 
modifications or substitutes to Licensee, but in such event Licensor retains 
the right to require the payment of an additional license fee, the amount of 
which shall be determined solely by Licensor. If Licensor, at its sole 
discretion, elects to grant to Licensee without charge a license with respect 
to any such  enhancement, such shall not be construed as a waiver of Licensor's 
right to impose a charge for the licensing of subsequent enhancements, 
modifications or substitutes.

8.0        LICENSE FEE

In consideration of the grant by Licensor to Licensee of the license set forth 
in Section 1 above,  Licensee shall pay to Licensor a non-refundable license 
fee, upon the execution of this Agreement.  A signed Licensee Agreement must be 
executed prior to shipment and will be required in order to receive technical support.

9.0 OWNERSHIP

Each Licensed Software System and all associated materials are proprietary 
products of Licensor and Licensee agrees that the Software System and all 
documentation pertaining thereto are and shall remain the property of Licensor 
before, during and after termination of this Agreement. The license granted 
hereunder is merely a grant of right-to-use the Software System in accordance 
herewith, and in no manner implies any ownership, proprietary right, tangible, 
intangible, intellectual or other property rights in or on the part of 
Licensee. Software is protected by the copyright law and may not be copied 
without the copywriting owner's permission.  Licensee may be liable for damages 
resulting from illegal duplication of the Software Systems or any part thereof.

10.0   CONFIDENTIALITY

Licensee agrees to hold all parts of the Software System in confidence for 
Licensor. Licensee further agrees not to make any disclosure of the Software 
System (including methods or concepts utilized therein) to anyone, except to 
employees or agents of Licensee to whom such disclosure is necessary to the 
use for which rights are granted hereunder.  Licensee agrees to appropriately 
notify all of Licensee's employees and agents to whom any such disclosure is 
made that such disclosure is made in confidence and shall be kept in confidence 
by them.

11.0     NON INTERFERENCE

Licensee shall not interfere with Licensor's business, particularly Licensor's 
granting of other licenses for the Software System. Neither party shall hire or 
attempt to hire any employees of the other party.

12.0   TAXES

Licensee shall pay any tax (and any related interest and penalties), however 
designated, imposed as a result of the existence or operation of this Agreement, 
including any tax which Licensee is required to withhold or deduct from 
payments to Licensor, if any, except any such tax constituting an income tax 
imposed upon Licensor by any governmental entity.

13.0    WARRANTY

Licensor warrants that the Software System will operate as described in the 
documentation provided as part of the Software System. If upon the basis of 
evidence submitted  to Licensor, it reasonably appears to Licensor that the 
Software System does not function as described in said  documentation, Licensor 
shall, at its own expense, correct any failure to conform to said documentation, 
which shall be Licensee's sole remedy.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 13, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS 
OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY.  LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Licensee hereby agrees that Licensor shall have no duty, if any, to provide 
warranty service for any modification or derivative of the Software System 
produced by any entity or person other than the  Licensor.

14.0    LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

   Licensor's sole liability under this Agreement shall be for the correction 
of defects in the Software System licensed hereunder to the extent of the 
warranty provided in Paragraph 13.0 hereof.  Licensor shall not be liable for 
any consequential, incidental, indirect or punitive damages or for any lost 
profits.  Licensor's maximum liability hereunder for damages regardless of the 
form of action shall not exceed the initial fees and other charges paid by 
Licensee under this Agreement at the time of shipment to Licensee.

15.0     ARBITRATION

The parties shall submit any dispute arising out of this Agreement, including 
the interpretation of or the enforcement of rights and duties under this 
Agreement, to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial 
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, in Los Angeles, 
California.  At the request of any party, the arbitrators, attorneys, parties 
to the ar-bitration, witnesses, experts, court reporters, or other persons 
present at the arbitration shall agree in writing to maintain the strict 
confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings. Arbitration shall be conducted 
by a single, neutral arbitrator, or, at the election of any party, three 
neutral arbitrators, appointed in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration 
Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall be 
attorneys in practice for at least ten years, and experienced in the matter(s) 
being arbitrated. In any such arbitration, California Code of Civil Procedure 
Section 1283.05 (Right to Discovery; Procedure and Enforcement) shall be 
applicable.  The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be enforceable according to 
the applicable provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure.  
The arbitrator(s) shall have the same powers as those of a judge of the 
Superior Court of the State of California, shall be bound by the statutes and 
case law of the State of California, and shall render a decision as would a 
judge of a Superior Court of the State of California.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, either party shall have the right to petition a court of competent 
jurisdiction, for (i) injunctive relief or other equitable remedies against 
the other for any violation or breach by such party of its obligations 
hereunder pending a decision by the arbitrator(s), and (ii) for a permanent 
injunction.  If proper notice of any hearing has been given, the arbitrator(s) 
will have full power to proceed to take evidence or to perform any other acts 
necessary to arbitrate the matter in the absence of any party who fails to 
appear. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
